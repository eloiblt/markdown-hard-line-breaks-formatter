# VSCode Markdown hard line breaks formatter

This extension allows you to :

- format markdown files using Remark
- automatically transform soft line breaks into hard line breaks (two spaces). This is useful for many tools that do not render soft line breaks.

## Examples

```md
test1
test2
```

Will be rendered as :

```md
test1__
test2
```

Where _ is a space.
